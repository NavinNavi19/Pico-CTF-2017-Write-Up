# PicoCTF_2017: Flagsay 2

**Category:** Binary
**Points:** 150
**Description:**

Apparently I messed up using system(). I'm pretty sure this one is secure though! I hope [flagsay-2](https://webshell2017.picoctf.com/static/2ad22210c6988d4ff6fafa34902078e9/flagsay-2) is just as exhilarating as the the first one!

**Hint:**

The buffer isn't on the stack, so you can't use your own pointers. Is there another way to get a pointer?

Make sure you know about using hn and $ in format strings
