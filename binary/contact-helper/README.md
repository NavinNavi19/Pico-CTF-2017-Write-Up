# PicoCTF_2017: Deep into the matrix

**Category:** Binary
**Points:** 200
**Description:**

In order to keep track of the contact information in our ever-growing organization, I made a simple helper tool. You can find it running at shell2017.picoctf.com:19239. [contacts.c](https://webshell2017.picoctf.com/static/e708b77d721589438c629a1396728f82/contacts.c)  [contacts](https://webshell2017.picoctf.com/static/e708b77d721589438c629a1396728f82/contacts)

**Hint:**

Is there a function pointer somewhere that you could change?

Learning about  [ptmalloc2](https://sploitfun.wordpress.com/2015/02/10/understanding-glibc-malloc/)  might help. glibc uses a modified version of it.
